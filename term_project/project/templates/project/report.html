<p>Our experience with Django was very good. Installation was seamless and configuration was easy to grasp once we knew how things were done in Django. Creating each page on our project was very easy. We didnâ€™t actually have to write large amounts of code in python because Django abstracts a lot of the technical aspects away from the development of a website.</p>
<p>When the choice was made to work with Foundation 6 as our front-end framework our team was excited. From the various online reviews and video tutorials, Foundation was considered in the top 5 best front-end framework for web design. We knew going in that there would be a lot of challenges learning this new framework. Challenges like, learning the extensive amount of style provide, overcoming the complexity for beginners and choosing the best fix for our project. However, once we spent some time learning the framework the challenges began to reduce and we were able to interact, and create a beautiful website with the framework.
    The installation and configuration of Foundation was very simple. We were able to get started in a very short period of time.Creating the web-page with the framework was slightly challenging, however the documentation help to guide us through. The learning curve was a lot steeper compare with regular HTML, CSS, javascript and even Bootstrap. However the beautiful designs were worth it. We decided to give our experience working with Foundation 6 a rating of 7.9 out of 10. This was due to the learning curve of the framework. We believe that the framework has performed as we expected when we first decided to us Foundation 6. We do not regret our choice and was happy with our experience. In retrospect, we have realized that more time is needed to gain more experience to bring out the true beauty of this framework.
